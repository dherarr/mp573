    "### Multi-repetition method for SNR measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain scenarios (particularly when imaging phantoms for the purpose of quality analysis), we may be able to repeat our acquisition multiple ($M$) times, in order to obtain $M$ images $S_{N,m}$, for $m=1,\\ldots,M$, that are identical except for the noise. Under the assumption of additive zero-mean noise, we can estimate $S(\\mathbf{r})$ at each location $\\mathbf{r}$ as the sample mean of our $M$ images: \n",

    "$S_{est}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M S_{N,m}(\\mathbf{r})$ \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the denominator $M-1$ (instead of $M$ as would correspond to the sample standard deviation) is needed to avoid bias (underestimation) in the estimation of $\\sigma$. An advantage of this method allows calculation of SNR at each pixel without additional assumptions about spatial homogeneity of $S(\\mathbf{r})$ or $\\sigma(\\mathbf{r})$. A disadvantage of this method is that it requires acquisition of multiple repetitions (often $M>10$), which requires longer scan times and also places strict requirements on system stability and lack of motion."

    "### Acquisition of two repetitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified version of the multi-repetition method described above consists of acquiring only two repetitions, $S_{N,1}$ and $S_{N,2}$, from which estimates of signal and noise can be calculated. Note that, in principle, one might apply the multi-repetition method described above to a two-repetition acquisition. However, the pixel-by-pixel estimates of signal and noise are likely to be noisy themselves, and so this approach is rarely used. Instead, a more common approach is to obtain the sum image \n",
    "\n",
    "$S_{+} = S_{N,1} + S_{N,2}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and the difference image \n",
    "\n",
    "$S_{-} = S_{N,1} - S_{N,2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this difference image can be attributed purely to noise (since the true noiseless signal should cancel out). Based on these images $S_{+}$ and $S_{-}$, one can find a region of relative signal homogeneity in $S_{+}$ located within a tissue of interest, and draw an identical region-of-interest in both $S_{+}$ and $S_{-}$. From this region of interest, one can extract the mean of the pixel values in $S_{+}$, which can be attributed largely to true signal (and should approximate $2 S$), and the the standard deviation of the pixel values in $S_{-}$, which can be attributed to noise (and should approximate $\\sqrt{2} \\sigma$). From these measurements, one can estimate SNR (over an ROI) as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hbox{SNR}_{est} = \\frac{\\hbox{mean}_{ROI} (S_{+})}{\\sqrt{2} \\hbox{stdev}_{ROI} (S_{-})} \\approx \\frac{2 S}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sigma}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables calculation of SNR over an ROI with only two repeated acquisitions, and with only mild assumptions about homogeneity of the signal and the noise properties over the ROI. Compared to the multi-repetition method described above, the two-repetition method can be acquired relatively rapidly and is less sensitive to motion artifacts and other instabilities, although it does not provide pixel-by-pixel maps of SNR. However, this method still requires the acquisition of two repeated images, so it may not always be practical. Next we review an even simpler method based on stronger assumptions. "

In this case, the assumption of Gaussian noise in the signal region is still typically accurate, but the assumption of Gaussian noise in the (magnitude-rectified) noise-only region is not accurate.
